# kinetoplast
The simulation package for kinetoplast enthusiasts

Python modules which model kinetoplasts as undirected graphs and simulate their dissolusion. Includes quasi-random, rectangular, triangular, and hexagonal 2D models, as well as quasi-random and hexagonal 3D models. Also includes special features like maxicircles and supersaturated boundaries if you're into that kind of thing. See teh documentation pdf for more information. Also included is a link to 1.7 GB of data used in an upcomming paper about this work.

Do note that I haven't really checked to make sure the code is fully releasable, so there might be some hard-coded directories pointing to locations on my computer. This is very convenient for me, but rather inconvenient for anyone else trying to use it. You might run into a few "File not found" errors before it finally runs. I'll try to fix that when I have time.
